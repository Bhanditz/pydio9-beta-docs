Overview

This tech preview is released in order to start detecting deployment issues on heterogenous systems. It is provided as is,
please note that Pydio9 is currently **NOT READY** for production. Use it at your own risks!

Distribution comes in the form of precompiled binaires for Linux and Mac OSX. Windows will come later in the process, but
will definitely be supported in the final release. A specific PHP front-end is also packaged and distributed, with an installation
process very similar to the current stable version of Pydio (8.0.1).
